# hello-world
This repository is to help me get a handle on what this tool does/is for.


My name is Chris, and I love being outside. I didn't used to though-this is a relatively new discovery. I biked 21.4 miles, today, and I've lost 50 lbs in the last 3ish months from biking, calorie counting, and working out a little. Adderall has helped me finally defeat some of my worst enemies lmao which has been nice, but I have a ways to go. I'm one year into a CS degree through Arizona State Online and I'm working my way through 100 Days of SwiftUI. I'm not particularly interested in being an iOS dev, just a remote dev who can build a cabin on a lake and kayak and fish and bike and have a wood fired stove and space for my kids to play. I'm pumped to keep learning and get to the point where I can start to actualize my dreams.
